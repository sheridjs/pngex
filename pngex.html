Utility.</font></p>
<p>This small utility was built to help the people at Simtropolis out
with their SCR project.</p>
<p>How to use it:<br>
<ul><li>First of all, to run this program, you need the Java runtime
environment. You can download it at <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads.html"
target="_new">http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads.html</a> if you don't
have it. I am told Mac users already have the Java runtimes built into
their operating system.</li>
<li>Next, extract the .jar file from the .zip file
provided here. Any directory will do.</li>
<li>Then double click the .jar file to run the program. (A .jar file
is an Executable Java Archive.)</li>
<li>In the program, you will see two buttons. The "Load" button tells
the program which file you want to extract .png files from. The
"Extract" button starts the extraction.</li>
<li>Files will be saved using the original file name. For example, if
the file you loaded is "myfile.xyz", the extracted .png file will be
named "myfile###.png". The ### is the number of the .png file it
found. If there is only one png file the name will be
"myfile001.png". If there are more, they will be "myfile001.png",
"myfile002.png" and so on. If there are no .png files in the loaded
file, nothing will be saved.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><u>Notes for this early version:</u> It is currently a minimalistic
version, but it works well. I removed the ability to find more than
one png to make it quicker. I hope to update it eventually to be able
to preview the png files within a file or set of files. Perhaps a
batch extraction option as well.</p>
